=========================
The HDFS XRootD Fallback system enables relaxed local Hadoop replication by
utilizing global redundancy provided by the XRootD Federation. This system
provides exception handling at the block level, a cache to locally store
repaired blocks retrieved from the Federation, and the ability to re-inject the
repaired blocks back into Hadoop.
